                    <p class="about-blurb">Angela Majestic is a senior at Michigan State University majoring in Computer Science with a Game Design and Development focus. 
                    Originally an accounting student because of her love for math, Angela found a new love when she took an intro level programming class her freshman year.</p>
                    <p class="about-blurb">Angela is now proficient in many programming languages such as Python, C++, C#, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. She's looking forward to sharing her knowledge in the fall as a TA for CSE 231 (Introduction to Programming). 
                    She hopes her students will discover their passion for programming just as she did.</p>
                    <p class="about-blurb">Although Angela is now a woman in STEM, once upon a time, she was known as the resident art kid in middle and high school. She now utilizes her art skills to create the assets for the video games she programs.</p>
                    <p class="about-blurb">When not swamped with programming homework, Angela loves to read fantasy and sci-fi novels, binge-watch TV shows, and bake desserts.</p>

                <p class="about-blurb">Angela started drawing at a very young age, and since then, she has honed both her traditional and digital art skills. For traditional art, Angela prefers colored pencils as her medium, but she has been known to use graphite, charcoal, oil pastels, watercolors, and acrylic paint. 
                For digital art, Angela is proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, and FireAlpaca. She uses these applications to create anything from realistic art, to cartoons, icons, and pixel art.</p>
